# LiftingProgram

Welcome to **Henry's Powerlifting Programs**!

This repository is dedicated to storing and sharing the powerlifting programs I've personally designed for my clients. My goal is to provide clear, structured, and effective training plans to help you achieve your strength goals.

## About These Programs

As a powerlifting coach, I understand the nuances of strength training. Each program here is crafted with principles of progressive overload, intelligent periodization, and recovery in mind, aiming to maximize your lifts in squat, bench press, and deadlift.

## Available Programs

Here are the specific programs currently available:

* **[Joe's Program](https://henry-chung.github.io/LiftingProgram/Joe.html)**: [Add a brief description of Joe's program here. E.g., "A beginner-friendly 3-day full-body routine focusing on form and foundational strength."]
* **[Kevin's Program](https://henry-chung.github.io/LiftingProgram/Kevin.html)**: [Add a brief description of Kevin's program here. E.g., "An intermediate 4-day split emphasizing volume and specific weak point training."]
